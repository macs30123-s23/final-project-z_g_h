# Introduction

##### In this project, we leveraged different machine learning models to predict the review stars of Amazon products from customers' reviews and the category of the product. The data is collected from the Multilingual Amazon Reviews Corpus (https://registry.opendata.aws/amazon-reviews-ml/) which is freely accessible from the AWS Open Data Registry. We conducted our analysis on English reviews and French reviews and successfully obtained a prediction accuracy of 95% on review stars by using a multiclass logistic classifier. 
# Problem

##### Customer reviews are a crucial indicator of a product's quality and could affect the future demand for a product. Sellers improve their products and services according to the review; buyers decide which product to purchase based on past reviews of a product. The problem of fake and misleading comments could cause many negative impacts on both consumers and businesses. Fake comments might lead customers to buy products that do not meet their expectations. When consumers encounter fake reviews, it becomes difficult to differentiate between genuine and fabricated feedback. This loss of trust undermines the credibility of review platforms and makes it harder for consumers to make informed decisions. Moreover, fake and misleading comment creates a disadvantage for small businesses with limited resources may struggle to compete against larger companies that can afford to manipulate reviews. Fake or misleading reviews can disproportionately affect smaller businesses that heavily rely on positive online reviews to build their customer base and establish trust. Thus, companies such as Amazon that provide online shopping platforms often put lots of resources into identifying and removing fake and misleading comments to protect their platform's reputation. By training a model that could predict a customer's review star, we could speed up and automate the process of reading and evaluating every review on a platform like Amazon. And it could definitely help identify potentially fake or misleading reviews. If a review comment strongly suggests a positive or negative sentiment, but the predicted star rating does not align, it may indicate suspicious activity or manipulation. Furthermore, our trained model could be applied to platforms where customers do not explicitly give a star or rating for the product they review, the predicted review stars could be used to categorize and analyze those reviews efficiently.

# Data and Method

#### The Multilingual Amazon Reviews Corpus contains reviews in English, Japanese, German, French, Chinese and Spanish, collected between November 1, 2015 and November 1, 2019. Each observation contains the title and content of review, the given star rating, the product ID and the product category. Reviews in each language include 210000 observations. To find the optimal classification models, we try to train a muticlass logistic classifier, a random forests and a multinomial naive bayes classifier and apply cross-validation to determine the optimal parameter for each model. The process of grid serach could be extreme time consuming, so it is essential to use tools from large scale computing to parallalize our computation to reduce our computing time.
